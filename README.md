# Unity Obstacle Course

A project made as part of the Berkeley Levi Lab, this project aims to determine differences in how people with lazy eye (amblyopia) and non-patients navigate the world. We created a program that randomly generates mazes in a Unity environment, and compares users to the optimal path through the maze, found using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
